## What is SiteSucker  

SiteSucker is a powerful macOS application designed to download entire websites directly to your computer, making them accessible offline. This is especially useful for developers, designers, researchers, and users who need to archive websites for reference, testing, or learning purposes.  

Unlike manual downloading, SiteSucker automates the entire process. It scans the website’s structure, including HTML files, images, videos, stylesheets, and other resources, and organizes them in a local folder while preserving the original hierarchy. This allows you to browse the saved site exactly as if you were online.  

The application supports advanced features like authentication handling, custom filters, and selective downloading. This means you can specify which types of files to download or exclude, optimizing both storage space and download time.  

Whether you need to back up a personal blog, study a web design, or test a website offline, SiteSucker provides a seamless and efficient solution. It’s lightweight, easy to use, and compatible with both Intel-based and Apple Silicon Macs.  

For professionals, SiteSucker Pro offers additional features for large-scale website archiving, perfect for businesses and agencies managing multiple projects simultaneously.  

With regular updates and macOS optimization, SiteSucker remains a top choice for anyone looking to access web content without relying on an internet connection.
